# Careers in Computer Science - Robotics Engineering
## **1.1 Basics**
### **_Career Description_**
Robotics engineers prototype, create, program and test machines. The machines created are used in the automotive, mining, space exploration manufacturing, servicing and other sectors. They work with engineers and project managers to develop the the design, maintain and fix the robots 

### **_Responsibilities_**
* Create robotic systems
* Develop a software which will control the robot and the electronic parts connected to it
* Create and design prototypes of parts and processors 
* Apply Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to the robots code
* Test the created robot
* Create a document explaining and describing the robots system
* Troubleshoot issues in the hardware/software of the robot
* Keep up with the developing environment around robotics and computer science
### **_Technical Skills_**
|Skill  | Description | 
|-------|:------------|
| Math and Physics| To predict, calculate and troubleshoot issues robot movements, calculus, physics and algebra are needed. Some knowledge of math is also needed when programming |
|Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing|CAD skills are significant as they allow to create a 3D model of the robot, making sure everything is aligned and sized properly. They also allow for the creation of custom parts needed to build the robot|
|Programming|Programming is important in creating connections between the electronics and hardware on the robot. Also in creating movement and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning algorithms for the robot. Popular programming languages in the career are Java, Python, C, C++|
### **_Non-Technical Skills_**
|Skill  | Description | 
|-------|:------------|
|Teamwork|Robotics engineers work in a team to finish projects alongside other engineers, project managers, developers and other members|
|Communications|It is important to listen and talk to other team members when working together on a project. Sharing and understanding information is crucial in a career which requires sharing of knowledge about the project|
|Collaboration|When working with others it is important to accept constructive criticism to improve the robot or project|
|Learning|Technology is constantly developing and growing, so it is important to learn and keep up with the latest tech in a career which incorporates both technology and engineering |
|Problem-Solving|With a lot of building and programming robots, there will be issues and errors. Having problem-solving skills will help troubleshoot and fix the errors|
### **_Required Educations_**
Any of the follower Bachelor Degrees are applicable:
* Bachelor of Engineering
* Bachelor of Applied Sciences
* Bachelor of Science
* Bachelor of Computer Science
* Bachelor of Mathematics
### **_Salary Range_**
The salary range for robotics engineers is 50K to 100K CAD
