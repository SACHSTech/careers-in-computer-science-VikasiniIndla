* Troubleshoot issues in the hardware/software of the robot
* Keep up with the developing environment around robotics and computer science
### **_Technical Skills_**
|Skill  | Description | 
|-------|:------------|
| Math and Physics| To predict, calculate and troubleshoot issues robot movements, calculus, physics and algebra are needed. Some knowledge of math is also needed when programming |
|Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing|CAD skills are significant as they allow to create a 3D model of the robot, making sure everything is aligned and sized properly. They also allow for the creation of custom parts needed to build the robot|
|Programming|Programming is important in creating connections between the electronics and hardware on the robot. Also in creating movement and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning algorithms for the robot. Popular programming languages in the career are Java, Python, C, C++|
### **_Non-Technical Skills_**
|Skill  | Description | 
|-------|:------------|
|Teamwork|Robotics engineers work in a team to finish projects alongside other engineers, project managers, developers and other members|
|Communications|It is important to listen and talk to other team members when working together on a project. Sharing and understanding information is crucial in a career which requires sharing of knowledge about the project|
|Collaboration|When working with others it is important to accept constructive criticism to improve the robot or project|
|Learning|Technology is constantly developing and growing, so it is important to learn and keep up with the latest tech in a career which incorporates both technology and engineering |
|Problem-Solving|With a lot of building and programming robots, there will be issues and errors. Having problem-solving skills will help troubleshoot and fix the errors|
### **_Required Educations_**
Any of the follower Bachelor Degrees are applicable:
* Bachelor of Engineering
* Bachelor of Applied Sciences
* Bachelor of Science
* Bachelor of Computer Science
* Bachelor of Mathematics
### **_Salary Range_**
The salary range for robotics engineers is 50K to 100K CAD
## **1.2 Standard Education**
### **_University and Program_**
Undergraduate Mechatronics Engineering program at the University of Waterloo
### **_Description of Program_**
The Mechatronics Engineering program will guide and teach students to design computer-controlled electromechanical systems such as robots, smartphones, 3D printers, drones, vehicles, satellite systems and more. It focuses on developing proficiency in mechanical engineering, control engineering, electronics and computer science. The program takes five years to complete with co-op, earning a Bachelor of Applied Sciences.

### **_Entrance Requirements_**
The admission average for the program is high 80s and low 90s\
Six M/U courses must be submitted, which include:
* Advanced Functions
* Calculus and Vectors
* Chemistry
* Physics
* English (ENG4U)
* One Additional M/U Course

NOTE: The average for each course must be a minimum of 70%
### **_First Year Program Courses_**
The following are some of the first year courses with a description:
* **MTE 100 Mechatronics Engineering**

    The course introduces mechatronics engineering and engineering in general. It will cover topics including the design process, project planning, data presentation, measurements, error, control logic, sensors and actuators. Skills in computer-aided drawing (CAD) are taught to create graphic multi-view, isometric, oblique, and perspective designs. The course also helps develop professional skills such as résumé skills, interview skills and helps prepare for co-op. There will be a group design project/competition along with the materials from lectures⋅⋅ 
* **MTE 121 Digital Computation**

    The course introduces electronic digital computers, their organization in hardware and software, and numerical algorithms for fundamental scientific calculations
* **MTE 100B Seminar**

    The course discusses the faculty, university, technical societies, as well as the structure of the mechatronics engineering curriculum.
* **MTE 111 Structure and Properties of Materials**

    The course discusses the relevance of materials to engineering such as the relationships between macroscopic physical properties (mechanical, photonic, thermal, electrical, and magnetic properties) and microscopic causes(electronic and atomic structures, atomic bonding, crystal structure, and microstructure). The course also describes the differences in macroscopic physical properties of metals, polymers, ceramics, semiconductors, and composite materials. 
* **MTE 119 Statics**

    The course covers the concepts of mechanics, vectors, statistics of particles, rigid bodies, force systems, equilibrium of rigid bodies, analysis of trusses and frames. The concept of distributed forces, centroids, moments of inertia, friction, internal shear and bending moments in beams are discussed.
* **MTE 120 Circuits**

    The course covers the basics of electromagnetic theory, magnetic, electric, DC and AC circuit analysis. In the topic of transistors, regions of operation and single-transistor amplifiers are discussed. 
* **MTE 140 Algorithms and Data Structures**
